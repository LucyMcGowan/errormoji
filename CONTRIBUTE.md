# Contributing guidelines

If you have suggestions for R error/emoji translations to add, please submit a pull request or add an issue. If you would like to request a translation, please add an issue.

Before doing so, please review the [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

You can submit a translation with or without additional explanation, or add explanation to someone else's submission.

### Without explanation, aka `verbose = FALSE`

Add your translation to the appropriate section, make sure the emojis render properly (and look the way you want them to look) on GitHub, and you're done!

### With explanation, aka `verbose = TRUE`

Everything above, plus

- üì¶: indicate the package that the error is specifically associated with (if any),
- ‚ùì: include a brief sentence describing when users might expect to see the error (with the aim of helping those who are unfamiliar with the error), and
- ‚úÖ: briefly (and generically) describe how you would debug the error.
