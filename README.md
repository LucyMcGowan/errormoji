# errormoji

Errors can be frustrating, but could they also be fun?

This repo is inspired by a [random tweet](https://twitter.com/minebocek/status/1035377949036486656) of mine which made me realize that there are others out there who enjoy emoji puzzles.

Deciphering errors can be difficult and frustrating, but maybe seeing them in emoji form would help lighten things a bit?

Note that I'm not suggesting we replace R errors with emojis (that might make them even more frustrating!) but I can see a venue for these in blog posts, talks, etc.

If you have suggestions for error/emoji translations to add, please submit a pull request or add an issue. If an error is specific to a package, please indicate that in your submission as well.
